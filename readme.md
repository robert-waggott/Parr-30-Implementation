Parr 30 C# Implmentation
========================

What is PARR 30?
----------------

The Parr 30 is an algorithm, created by the [Nuffield Trust](http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/), to predict hospital readmission:

> Following the Government’s announcement in 2010 that hospitals in England would not be reimbursed for some emergency hospital readmissions occurring 
> within 30 days of discharge, the interest in finding ways of preventing these became greater than ever. The Nuffield Trust developed an algorithm for 
> predicting which patients are most at risk of short term readmission, designed to be used by acute hospitals.

The algorithm has three basic categories:

* General information about the patient
* Information about the patient’s history of emergency admissions
* Information about the patient medical history
